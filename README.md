# BACK ORDER PREDICTION

## Problem Statement
  - Backorders are unavoidable, but by anticipating which things will be backordered,planning can be streamlined at several levels, preventing unexpected strain on production, logistics, and transportation. 
  - ERP systems generate a lot of data (mainly structured) and also contain a lot of historical data; if this data can be properly utilized, a predictive model to forecast backorders and plan accordingly can be constructed.
  - Based on past data from inventories, supply chain, and sales, classify the products as going into backorder (Yes or No).
  - The Problem is to prevent the unexpected strain on production,logistcs and transportation.
  - From then problem statement we need reduce the both False Positve and False Negative.
  - False Negative reduction will help us to prevent the unexpected strain on production,logistics and transportation
  - False positive is not that much important to the company because even if it is predicted as product is going to be backordered but actually is not backorded.
